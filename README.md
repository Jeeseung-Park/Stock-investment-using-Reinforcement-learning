# Stock-investment-using-Reinforcement-learning

Project that maximizes profits by investing in 11 main stocks in South Korea using 100 million won for two weeks.

we implemented two targets and online q-network rather than one q-network, and brought them from the reproduced memory to train them.
(The way DeepMind proposed in 2013) 

Also created q-network by enembleing two networks, CNN and LSTM. The Tensorflow framework was used, and the final result was 5 million won in two weeks.
